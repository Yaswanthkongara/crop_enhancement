The Crop and Fertilizer Enhancement System will provide the crop with optimized agricultural guidance based on key environmental and soil parameters. Some of the parameters taken into consideration are soil nitrate concentration, ratio of phosphorus to the content in soils, ratio of potassium, soil pH, and type of soils for the assessment of fertility and nutrient demand of the land. In addition, temperature, humidity, and rainfall data allow the system to determine conditions with optimal growing potential for crops. The previous crop in the same year and also the season under consideration will be added to the model to ensure crop rotation and sustainability. The values are now known, and the system is configured to give personalized fertilizer enhancements
